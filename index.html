		<h2> My dream </h2>
		<p> I was born in a family that has been doing business for generations. In my opinion, both my father and grandfather are successful businessmen. I grew up in a real business environment, and I have heard a lot about business and the lessons of failure. Since I was 10 years old, my dream is to be a respected businessman, I will own my company.</p>
		<h2> Reason 1 </h2>
		<p>	My hometown produces "black gold" (coal), and in the past 15 years, many billionaires have been born here. Last year, my uncle went bankrupt. He used to be one of the top ten rich people in my hometown. One of the most important reasons is that he cannot wisely manage money. At this time, I realized that making money may be possible without financial knowledge, but if I have financial knowledge, it can help me to manage my company in the future and properly allocate my assets.</p>
		<h2> Reason 2 </h2>
		<p>	The second time I decided to study for a master's degree in finance because of my father. When I was choosing my undergraduate major, he recommended me to study in finance. I disagreed with his suggestion. I insisted that data is the "black gold" of the future. The future is about data, 5G, big data, e-commerce and so on. I chose business analytics as my major, for which we have not talked for several days. However, when I worked in my father's company as an internship last year, I had an in-depth understanding of various departments. I attended different departments’ meeting. But I never fully understood the meetings of the finance department, and I was curious about the figures were calculated and counted. However, my father was an MBA graduate student from Peking University. When he was reading the finance reports from finance department, I realized how important it was for the owner of the company to have finance knowledge. Now, with my undergraduate knowledge, I can use many tools to process and analyze data. If I learn more financial knowledge in the future, it will be more beneficial to help the development of my company and broaden my horizon.</p>
		<h2> Reason 3 </h2>
		<p> The third time I decided to study for a master's degree in finance was last year. Last year my girlfriend and I went to Hangzhou to visit my close friends and teachers. Hangzhou is a famous tourist city in China, but I didn’t know where to have fun. I used this question as a potential business opportunity. It would be a good idea if I could build a software to help tourists and/or lovers know where they should go. In the following six months, my friends and I found over 200 interesting shops in Hangzhou, such as museum of lovelorn, private cinema, cat cafe, Ceramic art shop, archery hall, etc. Due to the time difference, I had to make at least 10 overseas phone calls to shops to try get cooperation in Hangzhou every night after finishing my homework. My friend is in charge of making this small-app. We put the store information on it, called Wakaka, and based on WeChat. We used money to promote it to various universities. But here's the hard part: we quickly ran out of money. We ran out of money and eventually the project was stalled. This was my first real startup and my first failure, and I realized that allocation of money is an art. The knowledge I have learned so far is not enough to help me realize my dream. I need to learn more knowledge to make myself stronger. At present, it is more worthwhile to pay money to schools to learn knowledge than to pay money to society to get lessons. At this point, when I heard that the University of Iowa had the 4+1 program. Not only do I save time, I also have one of the best finance professors in the world, and Tippie college of business gives students access to the real world of finance. Therefore, I firmly decided to study finance in the Tippie college of business.</p>
