		<h2> Before this Class </h2>
		<p> Actually, I just join in this class at the last minute, I am worry about the class because the class already started two weeks.But I am curious about software design</p>
		<h2> After join in </h2>
		<p>	Because it has been two weeks since I started the course, I missed the contents in this class two weeks ago. I also missed my first homework, and I couldn't understand the content of the class at all. I felt very panicked and thought too hard to study. Although I took A in other computer language courses, it doesn't seem to have much connection with other courses. I'm struggling to learn what I was missing before, and I felt stressed.
			I had wanted to ask the professor questions, but I was worried that my question was too simple. My professor looks proficient in various computer languages, and his professional level is really high. Therefore, I am more willing to take good real courses. </p>
		<h2> Now </h2>
		<p>	After studying hard, I finally understood this course. I started looking forward to this course, and I was really interested in it. I have watched the many times videos the professor made, and I want to take this course seriously. My professor is very good and so nice person. My first and second assignments were late, and he still gave me the opportunity to make-up. I will be totally pay attention to this course!!!</p>
